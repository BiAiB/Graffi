Graffi is an opensource JS charting library. It was created as an alternative to existing solutions in the goal of remedying:
-Requiring of Flash Technology
-dependance on a thirdparty js framework(like prototype) outside Raphael 
-lacking features
-lacking documentation (hope this point will be addressed)
